# pytest fast first

When applying TDD, a key to successful, fast development is quick feedback. This
plugin tries to shorten the time to feedback by ordering fast tests before slower
ones.

It measures the runtime of your tests and on subsequent sessions orders faster tests
before slower ones. 


## Installation

```bash
pip install pytest-fast-first
```


## Options

* `--ff-inverse`: Inverts the order (can be used to optimize the runtime of a test
  suite when run with xdist)
* `--ff-group-by-module`: By default tests are just ordered by their runtime. If 
  you have module-scoped fixtures, this can help with better fixture reuse.
* `--ff-filepath: Use the given filepath to store/read results. Default: .pytest-runtimes
## State file

The plugin creates the file `.pytest-runtimes` in which it stores the runtimes
in JSON format. If you want runtime-based ordering in CI builds, you can check
it in to your version control system (you will have to live with merge
conflicts though).
